        In modern systems, memory is virtual. This means that the memory address you see in a debugger (e.g., when debugging a program) is not the actual physical memory address in RAM. Instead, it is a virtual address managed by the operating system in units called <b>pages</b>. The typical page size is 4 kilobytes (KB). So, even if your program tries to allocate just 1 byte of memory, it will implicitly be given an entire 4 KB page.
      </p>

        It's often said that a pointer represents "some memory address," but what exactly does this mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        In a 64-bit system, a virtual memory address is divided into several parts. The low 12 bits (rightmost) represent an offset within a physical memory page. The high 16 bits (leftmost) are unused in current implementations. The remaining 36 bits are divided into four parts, each 9 bits long. But how does this structure enable memory addressing?
      </p>
      <p>
        When the CPU needs to translate a virtual address into a physical address, it performs a series of table lookups as follows:
      </p>
      <img src="four_level_paging2.png">
      <p>
        1. <b>Top-Level Table (PML4):</b><br>
        The address of the top-level table is stored in a special CPU register called CR3. All tables in this process are 4 KB in size, and each table contains 512 entries (since 4096 bytes / 8 bytes per entry = 512 entries). The first 9 bits of the virtual address are used as an index into this top-level table. The selected entry points to the address of a second-level table. </p>
      <p>
        2. <b>Second-Level Table (PDP):</b><br>
        The next 9 bits of the virtual address are used to index into the second-level table. The entry found here points to the address of a third-level table. </p>
      <p>
        3. <b>Third-Level Table (PD):</b><br>
        The next 9 bits are used to index into the third-level table. The entry found here points to the address of a fourth-level table. </p>
      <p>
        4. <b>Fourth-Level Table (PT):</b><br>
        The final 9 bits are used to index into the fourth-level table. The entry found here contains the address of a physical 4 KB memory page in RAM. </p>
      <p>
        The low 12 bit of a pointer is an offset in this physical memory page. The 12 bits is exactly how much it takes to encode a number between 0 and 4095. So finally we can address a particular byte in memory.
