        Mathematics Learning Journey
      </p>
      <p>
        I am self-studying mathematics through active engagement with textbooks, focusing on methodical problem-solving and reconstructing proofs independently before referencing solutions. This approach prioritizes deep conceptual understanding over rapid progress, often requiring months - or even years - to complete a single book, as it aligns with principles of sustained mathematical discourse. Beyond mastery of theory, my goal is to design interactive games that teach specific mathematical concepts, leveraging pedagogical strategies for dynamic learning experiences and informed by research on effective study methods.
